# Igris - Math Solving Assistant

Igris is an AI-powered math-solving assistant that allows users to draw mathematical questions on a canvas and receive accurate solutions. This project leverages advanced image processing techniques to interpret handwritten equations and provide step-by-step solutions.

# Features

Canvas Input: Users can draw mathematical equations directly on a canvas.
Equation Recognition: Uses Google Flash 2.0 API for high-accuracy OCR and recognition.
Solution Generation: Provides step-by-step solutions to recognized equations using advanced algorithms.
User-Friendly UI: Built with React for a smooth and interactive experience.

# Technologies Used

React: For building the frontend user interface.
Node.js: For backend processing and handling API requests.
Google Flash 2.0 API: For accurate equation recognition and OCR.
Canvas API: For drawing and capturing user input.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Use the canvas to draw a mathematical equation.
3. Click the "Run" button to process and display the solution(make sure to click twice as it can show some issue ).
4. View step-by-step explanations of the solution.

## Future Improvements

- Support for complex equations and symbols.
- AI-powered handwriting recognition for improved accuracy.
- Anime themed app for better engagement
